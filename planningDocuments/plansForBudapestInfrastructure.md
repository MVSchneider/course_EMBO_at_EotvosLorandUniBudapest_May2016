### Organising course content for Budapest 2016

#### Pre-meeting notes

- github OK for us as trainers?
- next time just expect trainees to use github pages as a static webpage, not mentioniing (or only doing it in an optional evening session) the bells and whistles this gives us
- would they be OK doing the git work themselves next time?

#### Notes from discussion

- we all want to use github again, don't want to change from it
- we'll try and get Marco, Miguel, Zsuzsa onto it
- Aidan has created a repo for Budapest https://github.com/aidanbudd/course_EMBO_at_EotvosLorandUniBudapest_May2016

### Training machines

#### Pre-meeting notes

- if Budapest has their own set of machines to run everything on, even though that means people use machines they don't know, I expect fewer IT issues?
- want to do it with a VM again?
    - they install local copies of a VM on their machines, run things locally, fewer problems with server (but maybe more problems with local/trainee machines)?
    - Ethernet instead of wifi?

#### Notes from discussion

- trainees work with their own laptops
- try making VMs that we provide on sticks to run as an option
- we agreed to use the command line and teach it - Allegra has great tutorial - we'll do in teams at the start, and then do speed dating later

### Software

#### Pre-meeting notes

- Decide today/tomorrow, while we're all here, the software we'll work with, then there's no delay next year waiting to hear who wants what, and someone in Budapest takes the job of making sure it all works on the system we'll be using?

#### Notes from discussion

We decided that we'll agree, now, to work with the following software list, and not add any other locally-needed-to-be-installed-by-trainees-on-their-laptop tools to this list:
- Required:
    - chimera
    - java
    - cytoscape 
    - jalview
    - cygwin (if in windows)
    - git
- Optional:
    - a gitviewer
    - clustalw
    - pandoc
    - awk


### Budapest program content

#### Pre-meeting notes

We'll have Natasha Wood and and Ora Schueler-Furman with us next time

#### Notes from discussion

- I'll bring a program to discuss on Friday, we'll discuss it after dinner
- We'll Skype some time before the Budapest meeting, to give us a chance to help link our material together a bit more strongly - we won't try to go for a strong shared theme - *maybe* try using insulin as a mini-theme
- Budapest will have some keynotes lectures
